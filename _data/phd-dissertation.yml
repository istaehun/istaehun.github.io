  - "Abstract: Today, users of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) adopt a variety of apps, use social features, and engage in crowdsourcing content as a public good. This dissertation explains their user community, i.e., a mobile virtual community, in terms of user contribution and its social-welfare value around urban areas. Essay 1 conceptualizes a virtual and spatial factor, i.e., virtual crowdedness, and addresses its role in encouraging user contribution. The findings are theoretically explained by the tension between prosocial behavior of and bystander effect on the mobile virtual community. Essay 2 theorizes whether and how user contribution, attributed to self-interest, supports social welfare for the whole citizenry. I found that user contribution improves the mobility of urban transportation and reduces social and economic costs. As an exemplar of citizen-data science, this dissertation takes a spatial and panel data approach to analyze the large-scale data on mobile app users, traffic conditions, and their locations in the urban region. The empirical findings are visualized and discussed to explain practical implications for mobile app design and policy on urban transportation."
  - "Essay 1: Smartphone users adopt a variety of mobile apps, use social features, and engage in generating content as a public good in real time. Their adoption and use of social mobile apps contribute to user-generated content that is crowdsourced by mobile virtual communities. Specifically, a mobile navigation app, Waze, enables users to: (1) initially generate traffic content (initial contribution via alert postings) in real time, (2) additionally amplify the content (feedback contribution via comments), and (3) collectively verify the content (confirmative contribution via thumbs-up) over time. This research conceptualizes a virtual and spatial factor, virtual crowdedness (defined as the density of nearby Waze users who are potential contributors from the viewpoint of a focal user) and examines its role in encouraging user contribution. The tension between prosocial behavior and bystander effect is explored to explain the impact of virtual crowdedness on the three types of user contribution. This research analyzes a panel dataset of user contribution from locations in New York City. The findings suggest that the tension varies by degree of virtual crowdedness, time of day, and types of user contribution. This research discusses practical implications on how app designers should visualize Waze users and improve the design of social features for encouraging user contribution to the mobile virtual community."
  - "Essay 2: Waze app platform, a mobile social media app, attracts user engagement and provides joyful opportunities for users to connect with others while driving. Earlier research demonstrates that users participate in forums hosted by social media apps because they tend to tap into their prosocial aspirations. In a mobile virtual community of Waze users, user engagement generates the forms of primary information, follow-up feedback, and collective confirmation and encourages users to share social sentiments with others. The growth in adoption of Waze and usage of its features might occur due to such social characteristics of user engagement. However, it is not clear whether user contribution, i.e., the outcomes of user engagement, leads to social-welfare consequences. This research examines whether and how the contribution to user-crowdsourced content generates desirable effects on social welfare by relieving traffic jams in congested urban areas. Utilizing large-scale data on behaviors and locations of Waze users in New York City, this research applies the spatial panel data approach to estimating the social-welfare value of user-crowdsourced content in the mobile virtual community. The results provide empirical evidence on welfare: user contribution by Waze users reduces the duration of traffic congestion around the urban areas. A welfare analysis estimates that user contribution saves 2.28% of annual total congestion cost per driver, $2,533, in New York City. This social-welfare value is achieved by user contribution that is effective in saving social and economic costs, as well as improving the mobility of urban transportation. This research discusses implications for practice of mobile app design and policy on urban transportation."
